### 1. *Introduction*

This document outlines the software requirements for a *Therapy App* built with Flutter. The app will facilitate communication between different user roles (Super Admin, Center Owner, Therapist, and Patient) for therapy sessions, appointments, progress tracking, and other related tasks.

### 2. *System Overview*

The therapy app will provide a platform for various user roles to interact with each other:

- *Super Admin*: Controls the entire system, managing center ownership, therapists, patients, and app settings.
- *Center Owner*: Manages a therapy center, therapists, schedules, and patient appointments.
- *Therapist*: Provides therapy sessions to patients, tracks patient progress, and manages schedules.
- *Patient*: Receives therapy sessions, books appointments, and tracks progress.

### 3. *System Features*

#### 3.1 *Super Admin*
- *Manage Users*: Ability to create, update, and delete Center Owners, Therapists, and Patients.
- *View All Centers*: View the list of all therapy centers and their associated data.
- *Manage Center Owners*: Assign or remove Center Owners from specific therapy centers.
- *Analytics and Reports*: Generate reports on system activity, therapy sessions, and user data.

#### 3.2 *Center Owner*
- *Manage Therapists*: Add, remove, or modify therapists working in the center.
- *Appointment Management*: Manage patient appointments, including rescheduling or cancellation.
- *View Patient Progress*: Track patient therapy progress and generate reports for the center.
- *Payment Management*: Handle payments for therapy sessions.

#### 3.3 *Therapist*
- *Session Management*: Schedule, reschedule, and cancel therapy sessions with patients.
- *Patient Progress Tracking*: Update and monitor patient progress after each session.
- *Communication with Patients*: Communicate with patients through messages or video calls for remote sessions.

#### 3.4 *Patient*
- *Book Appointments*: Book and manage appointments with therapists at the therapy center.
- *Session Feedback*: Provide feedback after each therapy session.
- *Progress Tracking*: View progress reports and session summaries.
- *Profile Management*: Update personal information and preferences.

### 4. *Use Case Descriptions*

#### 4.1 *Super Admin Use Case*
- *Use Case Name*: Manage Users
  - *Actors*: Super Admin
  - *Preconditions*: Super Admin is logged in.
  - *Description*: The Super Admin can create, update, or delete users for all roles. They can manage users at the Center Owner level, Therapist level, and Patient level.
  - *Postconditions*: The system reflects the changes made by the Super Admin.

#### 4.2 *Center Owner Use Case*
- *Use Case Name*: Manage Therapists
  - *Actors*: Center Owner
  - *Preconditions*: Center Owner is logged in and has access to the center's management page.
  - *Description*: The Center Owner can add or remove therapists working at their center, assign them to specific patients, and monitor their schedules.
  - *Postconditions*: The changes in therapist details are reflected in the system.

#### 4.3 *Therapist Use Case*
- *Use Case Name*: Manage Appointments
  - *Actors*: Therapist
  - *Preconditions*: Therapist is logged in.
  - *Description*: The therapist can schedule appointments with patients, reschedule them, or cancel if needed.
  - *Postconditions*: Appointments are updated or canceled in the system.

#### 4.4 *Patient Use Case*
- *Use Case Name*: Book Appointment
  - *Actors*: Patient
  - *Preconditions*: Patient is logged in and has access to therapist schedules.
  - *Description*: The patient can select a therapist, choose a time slot, and book an appointment.
  - *Postconditions*: Appointment is booked in the system and a confirmation is sent to the patient and therapist.

### 5. *System Architecture*

The system architecture is based on a *Flutter* front-end and a *backend API* (e.g., Node.js, Django, etc.). The architecture involves the following components:

- *Frontend (Flutter)*:
  - UI screens for each user type: Super Admin, Center Owner, Therapist, and Patient.
  - Authentication and Authorization (Role-based).
  - Communication interfaces (chat, video call, etc.).
  - Data visualization for progress tracking (graphs, reports).

- *Backend (API)*:
  - *Authentication*: JWT token-based authentication for role-based access.
  - *Database*: SQL/NoSQL database (e.g., Firebase, PostgreSQL) for storing user data, therapy sessions, progress tracking, etc.
  - *Real-time Communication*: WebSocket or similar for live chat or video calls between users.

- *Third-Party Services*:
  - *Video Call: Integration with third-party services like **Agora* or *Zoom* for remote therapy sessions.
  - *Payment Gateway*: Integration with payment services (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for handling payments.

### 6. *Non-Functional Requirements*

#### 6.1 *Performance*
- The app should handle up to 5000 users (Super Admin, Center Owners, Therapists, Patients) simultaneously.
- Response times for booking appointments and session updates should be less than 2 seconds.

#### 6.2 *Security*
- Data should be encrypted both at rest and in transit.
- All user authentication should be via secure login mechanisms (JWT tokens, OAuth).
- Role-based access control should be implemented to restrict users to only their authorized sections.

#### 6.3 *Usability*
- The app should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- The design should be consistent across all platforms (Android).
- User onboarding should be easy, especially for non-tech-savvy users.

#### 6.4 *Scalability*
- The system should be able to scale easily with the addition of new centers, therapists, and patients.
- The database design should support rapid scaling.

#### 6.5 *Reliability*
- The app should be available 99.9% of the time.
- The backend should support backup and recovery in case of system failure.

### 7. *Conclusion*

This document specifies the requirements for a therapy app that supports multiple user roles such as Super Admin, Center Owner, Therapist, and Patient. The app will enable smooth management of therapy sessions, appointments, and patient progress tracking. The application should be developed in Flutter for a cross-platform solution and should ensure high security, scalability, and usability.
